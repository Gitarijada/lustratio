How to: 4. Connect Domain to VPS: Log in to your domain registrar's DNS settings and create an "A Record" that points your domain name to your VPS IP address. 
Please be detailed, I never did it before. So fare I did connect myself to my VPS Ubuntu 22.04 server via Cmd.exe on windows 10.

To connect your domain to your VPS, you need to link your domain's name to your server's unique IP address. 
Since you can already access your Ubuntu 22.04 server via CMD, you have everything you need to begin.
Step 1: Find your VPS Public IP Address
You must use your Public IP, not a private or local one. Since you are already connected via CMD, run this command in your Ubuntu terminal:
bash (cmd)
  hostname -I   (short version)
  ip a
  curl ifconfig.me Not working
Use code with caution.

Result: You will see a string of four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 123.45.67.89). This is the address you will "point" your domain to. 
Step 2: Log in to your Domain Registrar
Go to the website where you bought your domain (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Hostinger). 
-Navigate to your Domain Portfolio or My Products.
Select the domain you want to use.
Look for a button labeled DNS Management, Manage DNS, or DNS Settings. 
-Step 3: Create the "A Records"
An A Record (Address Record) is what translates your domain name into an IP address. For a complete setup, you should create two records: 
Record A: For the Root Domain (e.g., example.com)
Type: Select A.
Name/Host: Enter @ (this symbol represents your root domain).
Value/Points to: Paste your VPS Public IP (from Step 1).
TTL: Leave it at the Default (often 1 hour or 3600 seconds). 
Record B: For the "www" version (e.g., www.example.com)
Type: Select A (or CNAME). WE DID 'A' (Select A), CNAME was not possible.
Name/Host: Enter www.
Value/Points to: Paste the same VPS Public IP. 
-Step 4: Delete Old Records (Crucial)
If you see any existing A or CNAME records with the name @ or www that point to different IP addresses, delete them. 
Having multiple A records for the same "Name" will cause your website to load inconsistently. 

Step 5: Wait for Propagation
DNS changes are not instant. It takes time for internet servers worldwide to update their "address books". 
Timeframe: Usually takes 30 minutes to 4 hours, but can take up to 48 hours.
How to check: Use a tool like DNSChecker.org or WhatsMyDNS.net. Type in your domain and select "A" to see if your new IP address is showing up globally. 
Note: Once propagation is finished, typing your domain into a browser will reach your Ubuntu server. 
If you haven't installed a web server (like Nginx or Apache) yet, you may see a "Connection Refused" error, but the domain is successfully connected!
